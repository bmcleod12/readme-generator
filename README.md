## Installation

As this is just a class project, it has not been added for public use in the npm registry, so we will install it the long way - downloading the code via zip file.

Please note these installation instructions assume you already have Visual Studio Code installed, as well as Node.js.

Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/


1. Click the Code button at the top right of this repository, then click Download ZIP.
